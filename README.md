# E-commerce Backend
This repo contains source code for the backend of an ongoing full stack personal project for an e-commerce solution. This project has helped me gain better hands-on understanding of how a secure backend solution is implemented.

This application makes use of the following tools and libraries.
## Tools
1. This project is written in [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs "Node.js Github Page").
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Database).
3. [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) (Formatting code in editor).
4. [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (Easy rerunning of app by saving “Node monitor”).
5. [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) (Server creation and communication).
6. [Dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) (Allowing access to .env file…making it accessible by our app).
7. [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) (Logging HTTP requests coming from the front end).
8. [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) (Responsible for handling all mongoDB operations from our application).
9. [CORS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any origins (domain, scheme, or port) other than its own from which a browser should permit loading).
10. [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) (helps hash user passwords).
11. [Express JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-jwt) (for securing APIs in a server).
